# ABC-Shopify-MicroService-Project
ABC Company sells a range of exclusive products across Sri Lanka through online. The existing system used 
by the company has developed using legacy technologies. Currently, ABC Company is facing issues with 
their existing architecture. Major issue is the deployment time taken for monolith webservices, which is 
impacting other functionalities to non-available during the deployment. As a decision made by the 
leadership, it has decided to rewrite the system using modern technologies and architecture which solves 
their existing issues with deployment and development.
